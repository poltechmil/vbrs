# Vertical Baseline Radar System

Vertical-baseline radar delivering true 3-D tracks from two synchronized 2-D radars â€” without GNSS. 

Timing anchored by an atomic clock reference (rubidium/CSAC) with fiber-distributed 10 MHz and deterministic hardware triggers, maintaining sub-microsecond inter-sensor alignment for coherent processing and reliable altitude estimation 

Range ~20 km

Altitude ~5 km
